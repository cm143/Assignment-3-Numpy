The purpose of this project was to create a list of the top 100 players ranked by field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, free throw accuracy, average points scored per game, overall shooting accuracy, average blocks per game, and average steals per game. I used np.loadtxt to load the data from NBA_Player_Stats.tsv, and I used np.sort and np.argsort to sort the top 100 players in descending order. I did not add any limitations.
